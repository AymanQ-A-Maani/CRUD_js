# General info
This project was done during the fornt-end phase of an online full-stack Bootcamp provided by an online educational institution called Knowledge Academy.
# Project's Aim
Students were tasked to create a CRUD system with local storage, using only HTML5, Bootstrap, CSS3, and plain Javascript. 
# Project's Components
In this CRUD, you should be able to add, delete, search and update the data in the table. It consists of two sections:
## 1. `Input Section`
This section consists of:
- Three inputs.
- Three buttons - One for adding data to the table, one for updating data in the table, and one for deleting everything in the table or some of it.
- Search bar - You can search by name.

***The inputs have a validation check which was designed from scratch using only plain JavaScript and RegEx Pattern.***
## 2. `Table Section`
This section is basically a table that presents all the data taken from the inputs after submitting them. Furthermore, this table offers many features; you can delete, update, individual and multi rows using the check box system that was also designed using only plain JavaScript.
